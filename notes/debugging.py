# CB 1st Debugging Notes

# Syntax Error - Coding grammer error
# print"vienna" <- bad
print("Vienna") # good

# Logic Error - Code runs, but it gives the wrong output\

# numone = "2" <- should be int
# numtwo = "5" <- should be int
# print(numone + numtwo)

numone = 2
numtwo = 5
print(numone + numtwo)

# Have a well though out plan, and when bugs appear, step by step go through our logic
# Rubber duck debugging: talking through a problem to someone else allows you to find issues easier

# Runtime Error - happen when your code is running
